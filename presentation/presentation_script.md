	- avoid potentially dangerous areas like dark, narrow roads. Drug hotspots. Hidden/not very visible for other people, parks, forests, etc.

### 6
two problems: data and routing


### 7
Map with polygons

### 8
Data gathering: Crimemometer, Google Places, Reviews, Users, Open Street Maps

image: Logos of sites(APIs, etc.)

### 9
Big clock

### 10
User feadback possibilies: preferences, report incidents, mark bad areas.
Safe good routes for yourself locally

### 11 
architecture

### 12
green areas

### 13
checkpoints

### 14
red/yellow zones

### 15
Example regular routing throug red zones

### 16
Example routing avoiding bad zones and including checkpoint

### 17
Example destination in red zone

### 18

Base algorithm is proven and most commonly used for routing.
Use of APIs ensures prove results
Our prototype provides meta-information and custom prioritization of certain streets

### 19

Diverse data sources and user-focused

### 20
Eve is back home safely and happy with our routing on her phone
